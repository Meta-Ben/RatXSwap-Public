`FACTORY` => this is the contract address of the factory you want to use

`YOUR_ADDRESS` => this is where you need to put the address of your DESTINATION wallet ( where the token freshly buyed will be send )

`YOUR_MNEMONIC` => the code has to access privatly to your wallet in order to spend money accross a swap platform , so here you need to put you private key

`SLIPPAGE` => this if the percentage of slippage you accept to loose in the transaction
`GWEI` => this is the Gas fees amount max you accept to pay
`GAS_LIMIT` => this is the gas limit
`MIN_LIQUIDITY_ADDED` => this if the min liquidity the token you want to buy should had for you to accept buying some

<h2> How to use :moneybag: </h2>

1 - Run : `npm run swap`

It will show you a prompt with the title of the project and a menu with a choice

2 - Enter like :
 2.1 - `1` to buy a token with BNB
 2.2 - `2` to buy a token with another token
 2.3 - `0` to exit the program
 2.4 - any other choice will restart the prompt

 then press enter

It will simply automatically : 
- get the pair address to do the swap
- get the liquidity
- show you a visualisation of the transaction that will be done
- approve the token you need to spend
- do the transaction
- let you know if it succeed or fail

Thats it :)

Enjoy !
